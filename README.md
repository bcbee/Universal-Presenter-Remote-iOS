#Description

Control nearly any presentation software from your iOS device or Apple Watch from anywhere in the world with UPR!

Using a presentation remote instead of advancing your slides manually can allow you to connect with audiences and utilize your presentation space more effectively, but you typically had to buy your own or hope the venue you were presenting at had one on hand. Fear no more, UPR has you covered!

All you need is the presenting computer, your iOS device or Apple Watch, and an internet connection. UPR allows you to control the presentation computer to advance your slides remotely from anywhere in the world. Simply install the UPR Controller application on the presenting computer and enter the token into the iOS App and you'll be presenting in no time.

Universal Presenter Remote natively supports both iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch with comprehensive instructions that make setup a breeze. Companion applications and further instruction can be found at https://universalpresenterremote.com.
